# Website Blocker (Windows/macOS/Linux)

A simple cross-platform GUI application that lets you block and unblock websites by editing the system hosts file. Blocked sites are stored in a searchable SQLite database and managed through a Tkinter interface.

---

## Features 

- **GUI with Tkinter** â€“ Add, remove, search, and view blocked websites.
- **Cross-platform support** â€“ Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Privilege elevation** â€“ Automatically requests admin/root access to modify the hosts file:
  - Windows: UAC
  - macOS: AppleScript prompt
  - Linux: `pkexec` or fallback to `sudo`
- **SQLite integration** â€“ Keeps a persistent database (`websites_blocked.db`) of blocked domains.
- **Input validation** â€“ Regex checks for valid domains and duplicate prevention.
